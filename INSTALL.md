# Installing

Installing is fairly simple, as <a href="https://github.com/FRC930/scouting_app/releases">releases</a> are published frequently, however, if you want to be on the bleeding edge of development, follow the steps below to compile from source.

1. Install the <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter framework</a>
2. Follow the steps on the Flutter install page to install all of Flutter's dependencies
3. Clone the git repository
4. Run `flutter build apk` or, if you have an emulator open, `flutter run`
5. The app should be working! If you have any issues, feel free to make a pull request or submit an issue.
