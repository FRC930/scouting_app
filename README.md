# BEARscouts

Welcome to the git repository for FRC Team 930's scouting app! This application is written in Dart and uses the Flutter framework. Currently this project only supports Android, but more platforms are coming very soon! 

*Note: iOS may be mostly supported, but has not been tested*

## Features
* Defaults to a configuration useful for the 2022 FRC season (Rapid React)
* Easily edit datapoints in-app using the built in configuration editor
* Password-protected configuration to prevent accidental data changes
* Flexible ordering using the concept of multiple pages (default: Pre-Match, Match, Post-Match)
* Ability to reorder widgets using the in-app configuration builder
* Export and import configurations to back up and restore your team's custom configuration
* Works "out of the box" using the default config
* Ability to rename the device (with color coding for red/blue)
* Exports data to a QR code for easy importing to a scouting database
* Supports export of up to six matches at a time

## Planned Features
* Pit scouting app
* Adding widgets to the middle of the configuration (not just to the end)
* Add web support
* Companion Google sheet to use with the app
