# Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome as needs arise or features are requested. We ask that all potential contributers take a look at the code of conduct before starting to make contributions to this project. All pull requests should be made to the dev branch, so that they can be integrated with the rest of the code base before being added to the stable code base.

The project maintainers will accept pull requests that meet a couple of critera
1. the pull request must meet an apparent need
2. the code introduced in the pull request must be formatted to match the rest of the project
3. the code passes analysis by the Flutter analyzer

When contributing to the project, know that the project maintainers may feel the need to reject pull requests that degrade the performance of the app or otherwise hinder the development process.
